## Overview

An AI-driven system that analyzes GitHub repositories structurally and generates personalized contribution strategies.

The platform combines:

- Static code analysis  
- Dependency graph construction  
- PageRank-based module centrality  
- Complexity scoring  
- GitHub OAuth skill profiling  
- RAG-based repository querying  

---

## Problem

Large repositories create high cognitive load for new contributors.

Existing tools:
- Provide browsing or search
- Offer LLM-based explanations
- Do not quantify structural complexity
- Do not personalize based on developer skill

---

## Solution

This system:

- Computes repository-wide complexity metrics  
- Identifies structurally critical modules  
- Adjusts difficulty dynamically based on user skill  
- Ranks low-risk contribution entry points  
- Generates a structured, personalized contribution path

## USP

**Personalized Cognitive Load Modeling for Codebases**

Unlike existing tools that only explain code, our platform quantifies structural complexity and dynamically adapts it to a developer’s skill profile, generating optimized, low-risk contribution paths through large repositories.
